# Cochise College CIS 221: Lab Manual

This is the lab manual for the Cochise College CIS 221, Digital Logic, class. The labs use the *Logisim-evolution* simulator and these labs are designed to teach all aspects of both combinational and sequential logic circuits.

* Lab 1: Introduction to *Logisim-evolution*: Students create a simple 2-Way, 1-Bit Multiplexer.
* Lab 2: Subcircuits: This lab challenges students to create two subcircuits that create a device to test a three-bit and four-bit input against a Boolean equation and output a high only when the proper inputs are set. This lab also introduces the test vector capability of *Logisim-Evolution*.
* Lab 3: Priority Encoder: This circuit continues to develop students' skill in manipulating *Logisim-evolution* and creating a slightly more complex circuit than the first two.
* Lab 4: Arithmatic-Logic Unit: This is the first of a complex combinational logic circuit and challenges students to create an ALU using some of the built-in devices available in *Logisim-evolution*.
* Lab 5: Vending Machine: this is the most complex combinational circuit in the lab manual. Students start with a Vending Machine simulation but are required to apply several modifications to the design.
* Lab 6: D Flip-flop Counter: This is the first sequential circuit and introduces students to several different four-stage flip-flop counters. The lab also introduces the *Logisim-Evolution* chronogram feature.
* Lab 7: Timer: This is a fairly complex timer circuit with an up/down setting and where the start/stop count can be specified.
* Lab 8: Reaction Timer: This is a fun circuit that builds a timer that tests the user's reaction time.
* Lab 9: ROM: This lab demonstrates how ROM works. The circuit builds a "Magic 8-ball" simulator and uses saying pre-loaded in ROM to respond to the user's yes/no questions.
* Lab 10: RAM: This lab demonstrates how RAM works and shows students how to work with bi-directional input/output pins on a device.
* Lab 11: Simple Processor: Students build a very simple processor for this lab. While it is not a Central Processing Unit it does show students how a code can control the flow of data around a simple loop and would be the most rudimentary introduction to CPU design.
* Lab 12: Elevator: This is a capstone project where students are given specifications for a simple elevator simulator and challenged to build that circuit.

This book was written with Latex and can be cloned and re-purposed as desired. The accompanying digital logic text book can be found at  http://bit.ly/2w6qU2C. Also, the author created a series of YouTube videos to help students complete each of these labs. Those videos can be found at http://bit.ly/2KLMcoc.
